# Troubleshooting

First move, always:

```
c2g doctor
```

It checks Node, workspace, bridge, MCP, OAuth and tunnel — and repairs what it
can (restarts the bridge, restarts the tunnel) without asking.

## Common situations

### "Bridge 未运行"
`c2g start` (or let doctor do it). Bridge logs:
`c2g logs`, or verbose: `c2g logs --verbose`.

If doctor says the bridge state is **uncertain** (无法确认), do not start a
second bridge and do not Delete the ChatGPT connector. Wait and run doctor
again. The local process may still be running.

### Everything was quit and ChatGPT can no longer connect
Quitting Claude Code / the terminal stops the public address. The next `c2g doctor`
starts a new address and sets `chatgptRepair.needed`. The Skill should tell the
user that the old address expired, then **Delete** THIS workspace's
connector (`chatgptRepair.connectorName`) and create it again with the new
address (never click Reconnect — the old URL is dead). Other workspaces keep
their own connectors so two projects can stay connected at once.

Mint the pairing code only when the ChatGPT Authorize form is on screen
(`c2g pair`). After the connector is recreated, doctor being green is not
enough: the saved ChatGPT conversation must pass `workspace_info` again. If
that old chat still cannot read the workspace, open a new chat in the same
Project (or switch long-chat) and continue there.

Fixed ChatGPT pages for first-time setup and later repair (do not hunt the UI):

- Developer mode: https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Security
- Plugins hub (manage existing connectors): https://chatgpt.com/plugins
- Add a connector:
  https://chatgpt.com/plugins#settings/Connectors?create-connector=true&redirectAfter=%2Fplugins

### Tunnel URL unreachable / ChatGPT says the connector is broken
Same as above: `c2g doctor`, then Delete + recreate THIS workspace's
connector if `chatgptRepair.needed`. Mint a pairing code with `c2g pair` only
when the Authorize form is on screen.
If this workspace uses a stable hostname, doctor sets `namedRepair` instead —
re-login to Cloudflare (`c2g tunnel login`) and doctor again. Do not Delete
the connector; the address did not change.

### I have a Cloudflare domain and want a stable hostname
During first-time setup (or the next coding session, once), say you have a
Cloudflare account and give the domain. Claude Code opens a browser for Cloudflare
login, then keeps `c2g-<project>.your-domain.com`. To stay on the temporary
address, say you do not have a domain. Switching later: tell Claude Code you want
the stable hostname; it runs `c2g tunnel choose --mode named --zone <domain>`.

### "配对码无效/过期"
Pairing codes are one-time and expire after ~5 minutes. Generate one only
when the ChatGPT Authorize page is ready:

```
c2g pair
```

Older codes become invalid immediately. Do not mint a code during `c2g doctor`.

### Temporary address keeps dropping on a UDP-filtered network
cloudflared defaults to QUIC. If the tunnel reconnects over and over on a
corporate network, set `C2G_TUNNEL_PROTOCOL=http2` and restart the bridge.
Leave it unset to keep cloudflared's default.

### ChatGPT gets 401 on every tool call
The access token expired and refresh failed (e.g. after `c2g unpair` or a
long offline period). Delete THIS workspace's connector if the address also
changed; otherwise run Authorize again in ChatGPT and enter a fresh pairing
code. Never use Reconnect when the public address has been replaced.

### cloudflared is not installed
macOS: `brew install cloudflared`
Windows: `winget install Cloudflare.cloudflared`
Linux: see Cloudflare's package instructions.
The Skill installs this automatically during setup.
If cloudflared is installed in a custom location that is not on `PATH`, set
`C2G_CLOUDFLARED_PATH` to the executable's absolute path before running `c2g`.

### ChatGPT steps stall with no visible tab activity
The `claude-in-chrome` extension is not connected yet, or lost its site
permission for `chatgpt.com`. Run `/chrome` and reconnect, allow the site
when prompted, then retry.

### Every new Claude Code chat “repairs” the connection / cannot write logs
The C2G state directory lives outside the project (macOS:
`~/Library/Application Support/claude-with-chatgpt`; Windows:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\claude-with-chatgpt`). Without an allow rule, Claude Code
prompts for permission before running the bridge CLI in each new chat.

`c2g setup`, `c2g doctor` and `c2g sandbox-allow` add this bridge's CLI to
`permissions.allow` in `~/.claude/settings.json`
(`%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json` on Windows). After that, later chats
do not need elevation.

### Port already in use
Handled automatically: an existing healthy bridge for the same workspace is
reused; anything else makes the bridge pick a free port. Configuration follows
automatically.

### Reading a file returns ACCESS_DENIED_SENSITIVE_FILE
Working as intended: `.env`, keys, credentials and anything matched by
`.c2gignore` are never readable through ChatGPT. `.env.example` is allowed.

### I cannot see Projects in the ChatGPT sidebar
Hover **Chats** /「聊天」, click the … that appears, and choose
**Organize by project** /「按项目整理」. Then create a project named after
this workspace, with **project-only memory**. Tell Claude Code「好了」when the
collection page is open (`https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-…/project`).

### This workspace opened the wrong ChatGPT Project
Do not pick another project by name automatically. Open the collection that
matches this workspace and tell Claude Code「已找到」, or say you want the old
long-chat instead. Each workspace has its own Project and its own connector.

### Completely stuck
```
c2g stop
c2g setup
```

re-creates the bridge, tunnel and pairing session from scratch. Existing
authorizations stay valid unless you also ran `c2g unpair`.
